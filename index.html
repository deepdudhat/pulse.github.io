                                        The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at
                                        their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging
                                        captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                        <strong>Signals, ensigns, and jacks</strong> of all colours were flying from her
                                        rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were
                                        two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender
                                        breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
                                        lamp.

                                        As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
                                        success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas
                                        numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish.
                                        Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far
                                        more valuable sperm, but additional <strong>supplemental casks</strong> had been
                                        bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck,
                                        and in the captain’s and officers’ state-rooms.
                                   </p>

                                        In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,
                                        and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on
                                        his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare
                                        coffee-pot and filled it.
                                   </p>

                                        The harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that
                                        indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons
                                        pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent
                                        testimony of his entire satisfaction.As this glad ship of good luck bore down
                                        upon the moody Pequod, the <strong>Barbarian Sound</strong> of enormous drums
                                        came from her forecastle.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                        Drawing still nearer, <strong>a crowd of men were seen standing</strong> round
                                        her huge try-pots, which, covered her with the parchment-like POKE or stomach
                                        skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
                                        hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing
                                        with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles.

Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew.
